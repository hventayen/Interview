First finding the window where the card must be added, I took the steps listed:
- list down what the alert card will look like
- map out all the breaches by date, name (more research needed)
- splitting it into two cases: breach or no breach
- providing button onClick{} functions so that the buttons existing will lead to dismiss or changing password(changing metadata of the user)
- accessing user metadata using Auth0 component library
- accessing card functions and design using Core UI library
