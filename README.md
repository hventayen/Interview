# Woven work simulation
Please complete the following challenges to the best of your ability.

Settlor â€“ Software Engineer
Please make sure you follow the prep guide to configure your environment before you click "Start The Work Simulation". Also, read these instructions in full before starting.
Overview
In this exercise, you'll work on 3 realistic engineering scenarios similar to those you might encounter working at Settlor:

1) Debugging a problem with limited information (35 minute time limit)
2) Check which pages users are authorized to access (45 minute time limit)
3) Show a user when their account may be compromised (45 minute time limit)
Available Languages
These are the available language choices for each of the scenarios:

1) Debugging a problem with limited information - JavaScript, Python, and Ruby
2) Check which pages users are authorized to access - JavaScript, Python, and Ruby
3) Show a user when their account may be compromised - React
If you feel that you cannot do your best work in any of the above languages, email us and we can try to accommodate you or suggest some learning resources.

Time guidance
The work simulation has a total time limit of 24 hours, but please note that each scenario has its own time limit, which is listed above. We enforce these individual scenario timers to ensure that you're on equal footing with candidates that might have more free time. We encourage you to take breaks between scenarios!

Although there is a timer in the assessment platform, we strongly recommend that you set a timer for each scenario. Since the challenges are independent, you don't need to complete one to make progress on the others.

It can also be helpful to set a timer for 23 hours when you begin working. This will alert you when you have 1 hour left on your total work simulation time limit.

All scenarios have extensive partial credit, so please show your work and submit any progress you make.

3 Challenges
This is the total number of challenges in the work simulation represented and navigable by the dots on the left-hand sidebar. You must attempt each challenge before submitting.

The following languages may be used in this work simulation:

On All Challenges
Only On Some Challenges 
1 Day Time Limit
This is the amount of time you are allotted to take this full work simulation. The timer begins when you start your first challenge and will not stop until the work simulation has been submitted or the limit is reached. After which point the system will lock the work simulation from any further changes.

You can view the time remaining in the bottom left hand corner and it will change color to indicate time is running out. You can also toggle to see time remaining.

Some of the challenges have their own time limit as well. You will be notified before beginning any timed challenge, and you can pause between challenges if you need, but the overall clock will continue to count down.
